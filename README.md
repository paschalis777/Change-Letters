# Change-Letters

This is a simple web application that allows a user to enter a text string into a form field and get various information about the text. The user can enter any text into the input field, and then click the "Submit" button to get the following information about the text: 

The capitalized version of the text. 
The lowercase version of the text. 
The number of letters in the text. 
The number of spaces in the text. 
The application displays the output in separate read-only input fields that are labeled with each of the above pieces of information. 

The application is implemented using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The HTML code defines the layout of the application, while the JavaScript code provides the functionality for processing the text entered by the user and updating the output fields with the corresponding information. The Bootstrap library is used to style the application and provide responsive design features.
